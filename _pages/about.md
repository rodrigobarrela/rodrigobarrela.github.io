I am a third-year PhD Candidate at Nova School of Business and Economics in Carcavelos, Portugal. 

My main research field is Labor Economics. I am currently interested in exploring topics such as wage cyclicality, inequality, and monospony power using large datasets, mainly Portuguese administrative data.

Previously, I was a Research Analyst at the European Central Bank's Supply Side, Labour Markets and Surveillance division of DG-Economics. I have also worked at the Bank of Portugal as a Research Assistant.

I will be joining the IMF's Fund Internship Program in the summer of 2024.

Feel free to drop me an email at rodrigo.barrela [at] novasbe.pt.
